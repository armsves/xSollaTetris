# 🎮 XSollaTetris

A modern take on classic block-falling puzzle games, built with Next.js and TypeScript.

## Game Mechanics 🎯

### Board & Blocks

- Game board: 10x20 grid
- Features 5 unique block types:
  - Line Block (I) - Long piece for clearing multiple rows
  - Square Block (O) - 2x2 block that doesn't rotate
  - T Block (T) - T-shaped piece for versatile placements
  - L Block (L) - L-shaped piece
  - Reverse L Block (J) - Mirrored L-shaped piece

### Core Rules

- Blocks can be cleared by:
  - Completing full rows (line clear like Tetris)
- Blocks automatically fall to fill empty spaces
- Win condition: Score 3,000 points within 180 seconds (Time-Based Mode) but can play until time's up

## Features ✨

- 🎯 Classic block-falling gameplay with modern mechanics
- 🎨 Color-coded blocks with distinctive visuals
- ⚡️ Special power-ups and combo system
- 🏆 Global leaderboard with score verification
- 🎵 Dynamic sound effects and visual feedback
- 📱 Responsive design with touch controls
- 🌙 Dark/Light mode support

> [!NOTE]
> Switch to light mode is coming soon!

> [!TIP]
> Admin can use secret password to access admin dashboard to delete data in leaderboard.
